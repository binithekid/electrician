      question: "What is considered an electric emergency?",
      answer:
        "An electric emergency encompasses situations such as downed power lines, electrical fires, electrical shocks, power outages during extreme weather, burning smells from electrical appliances or wiring, electrical hazards in water, and electrical equipment malfunctions in healthcare facilities. In each case, immediate action is necessary to mitigate risks to safety, property, or infrastructure. This includes contacting emergency services, turning off power sources if safe to do so, and evacuating affected areas. Prioritizing safety and following appropriate protocols is crucial when encountering any electric emergency.",
